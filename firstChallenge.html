    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <em>What is HTML?</em>
    <p>
      <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong>is the standard markup
      language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can
      be assisted by technologies such as
      <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> and scripting languages such
      as <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web Browesers receive <b>HTML</b> documents from a <em>web server</em> or
      from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page <i>semantically</i> and
      originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

      <strong>HTML</strong> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With
      HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
      embedded into the renderred page. HTML provides a means to create
      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
      headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
      are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;
      img/&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page.
      Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about
      document text and may include other tagsas sub-elements. Browsers do not
      display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
