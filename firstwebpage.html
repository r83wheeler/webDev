<b>HTML Semantics</b>
<p>
  In addition to specifying markup, <em>HTML5</em> specifies scripting
  application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be used with
  JavaScript.[104] Existing Document Object Model (DOM) interfaces are extended
  and de facto features documented. There are also new APIs, such as:
  Canvas;[105] Timed Media Playback;[106] Offline;[107] Editable content;[108]
  Drag and drop;[109] History;[110] MIME type and protocol handler
  registration;[111][112] Microdata;[113] Web Messaging;[114] Web Storage â€“ a
  key-value pair storage framework that provides behavior similar to cookies but
  with larger storage capacity and improved API.[115]
